# Skill: Manage Async Workloads in Apache OFBiz

## Goal
To properly manage asynchronous execution, scheduled jobs, and the `JobSandbox` in OFBiz, ensuring stability and preventing infinite loops or resource starvation.

Asynchronous logic in OFBiz can be triggered via `dispatcher.runAsync()`, scheduled Quartz jobs, Service ECAs (`mode="async"`), and the `JobSandbox` recurrences. While powerful, async execution is often misunderstood and can lead to severe system instability if misused.

## Triggers
- When deciding whether a service or ECA should use `mode="async"` or `mode="sync"`.
- When designing solutions for high-volume background tasks, data imports, or heavy operations.
- When configuring background jobs through the `JobSandbox`.

## Rules & Procedures

### 1. Async is CONCURRENT, not "Later"
**Critical Clarification**: Async does not mean "run later". It means "run concurrently".
- Async runs in a separate thread.
- It starts a new transaction.
- It may execute *before* the triggering transaction commits.
- Reads may see no data or partial data.

*Why this matters*: Agents often falsely assume "Async = safe follow-up after main work". In OFBiz, this assumption is false unless commit boundaries are strictly enforced (e.g., using `event="commit"` in a SECA).

### 2. Large Data Imports or Batch Workloads
For large data imports or batch workloads:
- **Prefer batching + synchronous execution.**
- Process one record per transaction inside a controlled loop.
- **Avoid** one async service invocation per record.

## Guardrails

### 1. Async is NOT a Scalability Strategy at High Volume
Running hundreds or thousands of heavy operations asynchronously does not make them faster.
- Database contention increases.
- Throughput drops and commit times increase.
- The overall system becomes unstable.
- *Rule*: Volume + DB-heavy work → async makes things worse. Avoid choosing async reflexively when you see "heavy" work.

### 2. Persisted Async Jobs Can DOS Your Own System
A massive number of persisted async operations causes a "JobSandbox explosion".
- **Example**: If processing 500,000 records creates 500,000 persisted async jobs, the `JobSandbox` itself becomes the system bottleneck, not the business logic.
- An agent or junior dev may think `persist="true"` equals "safer". But at scale, DB I/O explodes, and the service engine spends more time managing jobs than executing work.
- **Rule**: Persisted async services must ONLY be used when the job creation rate is ≤ the job consumption rate.

### 3. Resource Contention Warning
Async services share CPU, memory, threads, and DB connections with synchronous services.
- Excessive async workloads can starve UI and interactive business flows.
- Async usage must be evaluated in the context of the total system workload.

## Async Decision Checklist
Before choosing an async approach, you must answer **YES** where applicable. If these questions cannot be answered clearly, async is likely the wrong choice:
- [ ] Does this work need to block the user? (If no, async *might* be appropriate, subject to volume).
- [ ] Does it depend on data created in another transaction?
- [ ] What is the expected volume per hour/day? (Volume must be controlled).
- [ ] Can failures be delayed or retried safely?
- [ ] Is batching a better alternative?
- [ ] Should this run only after commit?
- [ ] Does the infrastructure support the async load?
