# Skill: Manage Service and Entity ECAs (SECA / EECA) in Apache OFBiz

## Goal
To implement event-driven logic in OFBiz by triggering services automatically when another service reaches a lifecycle event (SECA) or a database entity is modified (EECA).

ECAs are powerful — but misused ECAs are one of the fastest ways to destabilize a production OFBiz system.

> **Core Principle**: If removing the ECA breaks the main business flow, it should **NOT** be an ECA.

## Triggers
- Implementing cross-cutting concerns (e.g., clearing caches, indexing).
- Triggering side effects (e.g., sending emails after order completion).
- Enforcing business rules that depend on data changes.
- Syncing data between different systems or components.

## Rules & Procedures

### Decision Tree: SECA vs EECA vs Explicit Chaining

**Step 1: Is this logic part of the main business flow?**
Examples: "Order approval must reserve inventory", "Shipment creation must validate allocation", "Invoice must be generated or order is invalid".
- **YES** → **Explicit chaining / orchestrator service**
  - (Call the next service directly, or create a wrapper service like `processOrderApproval` that orchestrates steps.)
- **NO** → Go to Step 2
*Rule: If removing it breaks the flow, it’s not an ECA.*

**Step 2: What is the trigger source you truly want?**
Ask: "What event should cause this to happen?"
- **2A) Trigger is a service lifecycle event**
  - Example: "After `storeOrder` completes, send an email", "After `createShipment` commits, push to ERP".
  - **Choose SECA**
  - Then go to Step 3 (event + mode)
- **2B) Trigger is a database row change**
  - Example: "Whenever Product changes, reindex", "When OrderHeader.statusId becomes COMPLETED, notify".
  - **Choose EECA** (only on physical entities)
  - Then go to Step 3 (event + mode)
- *If neither is clear → prefer explicit chaining (more traceable).*

**Step 3: Does the triggered work need committed DB state?**
Ask: "Will the triggered service read data written by the triggering work?"
- **YES** → Use post-commit trigger
  - **SECA**: `event="commit"`
  - **EECA**: prefer `event="return"` but ensure the consuming logic doesn’t require uncommitted visibility; if it must read committed state reliably, prefer SECA on commit of the creating/updating service (or pass required data directly).
- **NO** → `return` is usually fine
  - (SECA: `event="return"`, EECA: `event="return"`)
*Key: async is concurrent; commit matters when reads must see written data.*

**Step 4: Is the action heavy / slow / failure-tolerant?**
Examples: external API call, email, indexing, analytics.
- **YES** → `mode="async"`
  - Use `persist="true"` only when job volume is controlled and reliability is required.
  - *(See the [manage-async](../manage-async/SKILL.md) skill before choosing `mode="async"`!)*
- **NO** → `mode="sync"` (keep it lightweight and deterministic)

### Quick Rules of Thumb

**Use Explicit Chaining when:**
- It’s core workflow logic
- Ordering matters strongly across multiple steps
- You need clear traceability and testing
- You want retries/compensation explicitly

**Use SECA when:**
- Trigger is "after service X"
- You want to extend behavior without changing service code
- You can pick `return` vs `commit` intentionally

**Use EECA when:**
- Trigger is "when entity row changes"
- You need cross-cutting reaction to DB writes from multiple entry points
- You can write precise conditions
- You are not targeting view entities and not using `find`

### Implementation Procedures

#### 1. Service ECAs (SECAs)
SECAs trigger a service when another service reaches a specific life-cycle event.

- **Location**: Typically defined in `secas.xml` files within a component's `servicedef` directory.
- **Registration**: Register the SECA file in `ofbiz-component.xml`:
  ```xml
  <service-resource type="eca" loader="main" location="servicedef/secas.xml"/>
  ```

#### SECA Pattern
```xml
<eca service="serviceName" event="event-name">
    <!-- Optional Conditions -->
    <condition field-name="statusId" operator="equals" value="ORDER_COMPLETED"/>
    <!-- Actions -->
    <action service="triggerService" mode="sync|async" persist="true|false"/>
</eca>
```

#### Event Selection Rules
- **return**: Business logic completed, transaction not yet committed (most common).
- **commit**: Use ONLY when the triggered service must see committed data.
- **invoke**: Avoid "invoke" unless modifying input context is required.
- `auth`: Before authentication.
- `in-validate`: Before input validation.
- `out-validate`: Before output validation.

---

#### 2. Entity ECAs (EECAs)
EECAs trigger a service when a database operation occurs on a specific entity.

- **Location**: Typically defined in `eecas.xml` files within a component's `entitydef` directory.
- **Registration**: Register the EECA file in `ofbiz-component.xml`:
  ```xml
  <entity-resource type="eca" loader="main" location="entitydef/eecas.xml"/>
  ```

#### EECA Pattern
```xml
<eca entity="EntityName" operation="create|store|remove|find" event="validate|run|return|status-change">
    <condition field-name="fieldName" operator="not-equals" value="N"/>
    <action service="triggerService" mode="sync" value-attr="currentValue"/>
</eca>
```

#### Critical Constraints
- NEVER attach EECA to view entities.
- Avoid `operation="find"` (high performance risk).
- ✔ Prefer `store` + condition over `status-change` when possible.

#### Event Rules
- **run**: Before DB operation (rare).
- **return**: After DB operation (most common).
- **status-change**: Use ONLY for explicit status-driven logic.

**Common Operations**: `create`, `store` (update), `remove`.

## Guardrails
- **Avoid Recursion**: Be extremely careful not to trigger a SECA/EECA that eventually calls the original service/entity operation, leading to an infinite loop (see Examples).
- **Transactional Impact**: Synchronous (`mode="sync"`) actions run in the same transaction. If the action fails, the main operation fails.
- **Condition Precision**: Always use conditions to ensure the action only triggers when strictly necessary.
- **Async Execution Warning**: Before configuring `mode="async"`, you **MUST** review the explicit rules in the `manage-async` skill to prevent JobSandbox explosions and system instability.

## Examples: Good Patterns vs Anti-Patterns

### 1. Order Completion SECA (Good Pattern for Live Traffic)
Triggering an email and resetting totals after an order is stored.
```xml
<eca service="storeOrder" event="return">
    <condition field-name="orderTypeId" operator="equals" value="SALES_ORDER"/>
    <action service="resetOrderGrandTotal" mode="sync"/>
    <action service="sendOrderConfirmationEmail" mode="async" persist="true"/>
</eca>
```
**Why this is good (for live traffic)**: It decouples the heavy network call (email) from the transaction, avoiding blocking the user during checkout.

**ANTI-PATTERN: Leaving this enabled for bulk historical imports.**
This async + persist strategy is **WRONG** if:
- You are **bulk-importing historical orders** (JobSandbox explosion).
- The email must be sent **before** order completion is considered successful.
- The service modifies `OrderHeader` again (leading to transaction timing collisions).
- You are firing this for **every minor order update** (missing `<condition>` guard).

### 2. Infinite Loop Recursion (EECA ANTI-PATTERN)
**NEVER** trigger an action that updates the exact same entity that triggered it, unless guarded by iron-clad status conditions.
```xml
<eca entity="OrderHeader" operation="store" event="return">
    <action service="recomputeOrderHeader" mode="sync"/>
</eca>
```
**Why this is dangerous**: When `recomputeOrderHeader` executes, it internally stores `<OrderHeader>`. Because the operation is `store`, the EECA immediately fires a *second* time. This creates an infinite loop that instantly crashes the transaction thread.

### 3. View Entity trigger (EECA ANTI-PATTERN)
**NEVER** attach an EECA to a View Entity.
```xml
<!-- WRONG: OrderHeaderAndItems is a View Entity -->
<eca entity="OrderHeaderAndItems" operation="store" event="return">
    <action service="triggerCustomLogic" mode="sync"/>
</eca>
```
**Why this is wrong**: View Entities are virtual joins. The OFBiz Entity Engine does not fire database events (`create`, `store`, `remove`) on views—it fires them on the underlying physical tables. An EECA on a View Entity will either never trigger, or will trigger inconsistently and cause deep system confusion.

### 4. Find Operation (EECA ANTI-PATTERN)
**NEVER** attach an EECA to a `find` operation unless absolutely unavoidable and closely monitored.
```xml
<!-- WRONG: High performance risk -->
<eca entity="Product" operation="find" event="return">
    <action service="triggerExpensiveCheck" mode="sync"/>
</eca>
```
**Why this is dangerous**: Find operations are executed continuously by the system (UI lookups, internal service logic, batch processing). Intercepting every `find` operation on a core entity like `Product` adds massive latency to the system and will destroy database throughput.

### 5. Product Keyword Indexing EECA
Automatically indexing keywords whenever a Product is created or updated.
```xml
<eca entity="Product" operation="create" event="return">
    <action service="indexProductKeywords" mode="sync" value-attr="productInstance"/>
</eca>
<eca entity="Product" operation="store" event="return">
    <action service="indexProductKeywords" mode="sync" value-attr="productInstance"/>
</eca>
```
